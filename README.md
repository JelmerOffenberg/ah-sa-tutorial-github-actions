# Welcome to the AH CI/CD with Github Actions hands-on session.



# Exercise 1 - Fork this repository
For this hands-on session you'll need some boilerplate code that we created for you. This ensures that you can focus on the CI/CD components instead of on irrelevant problems. To make your own copy of this repository you should fork it! A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Fork this repository to your personal Github account. *Note*: We work on our personal accounts without any company data so that are in full control.


# Exercise 2 - Run pytest and pre-commit on your machine
This repository contains a sample Python based project. We've added a few tests in the tests directory. We'll now focus on running both PyTest and pre-commit. You will typically run your tests and pre-commit before pushing your code to the repository. We can reuse the knowledge from this step for the next exercise.
- Install pre-commit and run pre-commit on the repository.
- Use pytest to run the tests in this directory

# Exercise 3 - Write your first YAML file that runs pre-commit and pytest
You might want to check the extensive documentation for help on syntax and definitions: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions.


# Exercise 4 - Update your pipeline YAML file so that it triggers a test & build when the acceptance branch receives a new commit.



# Exercise 5a - Update your pipline YAML file so that it triggers a test & build when a pull request is initiated from acceptance to master.



# Exercise 5b (optional) - Can update your CI/CD so that it will trigger builds for certain tags?



# Exercise 6 - Deployment
